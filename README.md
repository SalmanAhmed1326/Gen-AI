## Text-to-Image Generation

This project leverages the **Stable Diffusion Pipeline** from the `diffusers` library to generate images based on textual prompts. The pipeline uses a pretrained Stable Diffusion model, configured for high-quality image generation.

### Key Features
- Generate custom images based on text prompts.
- Fine-tuned with specific parameters like guidance scale and image size.
- Seed control for reproducibility.

```python
prompt = "a boy with a dog"
image = generate_image(prompt, image_gen_model)
image.show()
```

### Output Example
Prompt: *"A boy with a dog in a forest."*  
Generated Image: *(Rendered using Stable Diffusion)*

## Language Translation and Image Generation

This project integrates Google Translate and Stable Diffusion to translate prompts into English before generating corresponding images. It demonstrates multilingual support for creative image generation.

### Key Features
- Translate text prompts from any language to English.
- Generate corresponding images for real-world scenarios.

```python
translation = get_translation("प्रजें होली मना रही हैं", "en")
image = generate_image(translation, image_gen_model)
image.show()
```

### Output Example
Original Text: *"ప్రజలు హోలీ జరుపుకుంటున్నారు"*  
Translated Text: *"People are celebrating Holi."*  
Generated Image: *(Rendered using Stable Diffusion)*

## PDF Text Extraction and Question Answering

This project demonstrates the use of LLMs for extracting meaningful insights from large documents, such as PDFs. By leveraging `LangChain`, embeddings from `HuggingFace`, and a vector store like Chroma, the project enables semantic search and question-answering on document data.

### Key Features
- Extract and preprocess text from PDF files.
- Chunk text into manageable pieces to ensure efficient token processing.
- Perform semantic search on document text and answer user queries using LLMs.

```python
query = "What is LLM?"
docs = document_search.similarity_search(query)
response = chain.run(input_documents=docs, question=query)
print(response)
```

### Example Queries
- **Query**: *"What are Transformers?"*  
  **Response**: *(Detailed explanation based on document content)*

## Additional Ideas and Extensions

The repository includes placeholders and ideas for further exploration, such as:
- **Audio-to-Text Generation**: Use ASR models to transcribe audio and generate visual representations of spoken content.
- **Video-to-Image Summarization**: Extract meaningful frames from videos and annotate them with captions.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Experiment with fine-tuning models on custom datasets to improve accuracy and personalization.
